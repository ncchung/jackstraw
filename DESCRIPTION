Description: Test for association between the observed data and their estimated latent variables. Latent variable models such as principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), and related methods can capture systematic patterns of variations in high-dimensional data, by low-dimensional embeddings. The jackstraw enables statistical testing for association between observed variables and latent variables, as estimated by principal components (PCs) or related estimates. Similarly, unsupervised clustering, such as K-means clustering, partition around medoids (PAM), and others, finds coherent groups in high-dimensional data. The jackstraw estimates statistical significance of cluster membership, by testing association between data and cluster centers. Clustering membership can be improved by using the resulting jackstraw p-values, with an application to unsupervised evaluation of cell identities in single cell RNA-seq. This package also implements posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) that can be used for feature selection of genes, cells, and others.
