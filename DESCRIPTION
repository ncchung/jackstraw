Description: Test for association between the observed data
	and their systematic patterns, that are often extracted by unsupervised learning.
	Latent variables in high-dimensional data may be estimated by principal component analysis, factor analysis, and related methods. Subpopulations among the observed data may be determined by K-means clustering, partition around medoids (PAM), and other algorithms.
