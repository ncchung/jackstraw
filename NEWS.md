# jackstraw 1.3.2 (2020-12-23)

* Fixed lots of minor things that caused `check` errors
  * Vignette: minor edits to fix recent build errors
  * Moved external package imports from R code to `DESCRIPTION`, adding missing packages, and fixed namespaces.
  * Corrected function arguments and usage discrepancies.
* Added this `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

# jackstraw 1.3.3 (2021-03-09)

Overview:

- Added unit tests to almost all functions
  - Basic uses are covered (default optional parameters), and some but not all advanced uses
- Minor user-facing changes: 
  - Moved mandatory arguments to the front (no backward-incompatible problems since these arguments had to be called by name unless the earlier optional arguments were also present and were passed unnamed (rare))
  - Added more informative error messages for missing mandatory arguments, objects with wrong classes, and covariate dimension disagreements
  - Minor bug fixes (some `s = 1` edge cases)
  - Eliminated all non-error/warning verbosity when `verbose = FALSE`.

Additional details:

- Function `jackstraw_cluster`
  - Added option `pool` (default `TRUE`) to calculate p-values by pooling null statistics (to match `jackstraw_kmeans` option and default).  Previously the hardcoded behavior matched `pool = FALSE`.
- Functions `jackstraw_lfa`, `jackstraw_alstructure`, `jackstraw_pca`, `jackstraw_rpca`, `jackstraw_irlba`, `jackstraw_subspace`:
  - Argument `r` is now second argument.
    - `lfa`, `alstructure`, `subspace` versions: `r` does not have a default value and it is mandatory.
- Functions `jackstraw_kmeans`, `jackstraw_kmeanspp`, `jackstraw_MiniBatchKmeans`, `jackstraw_pam`, `jackstraw_cluster`:
  - Debugged `s = 1` edge case: null data used to be centered incorrectly.
    Bug only occurred in combination with `center = TRUE` (default).
- Internal (unexported) function `RSS` now returns actual residual sum of squares.  This change does not affect any exported functions that use it.  Previously `RSS` calculated a normalized version (equal to `1 - R^2`), but this normalization canceled out in `FSTAT` (its only downstream use), so the normalization had no user-facing effect.

Exclusive list of functions without unit tests (all are redundant with other packages, so they are candidates for removal in the near future):

- Exported: 
  - `lfa.corpcor` (redundant with `lfa::lfa`)
  - `pi0est_bootstrap` (redundant with `qvalue::pi0est`)
- Internal, no exported backward dependencies:
  - `getp` (redundant with `qvalue::empPvals`)
  - `devdiff_parallel` (redundant with `gcatest::gcat.stat`)

# jackstraw 1.3.4.9000 (2021-04-14)

- Functions `jackstraw_pca`, `jackstraw_rpca`, `jackstraw_irlba`:  Corrected documentation (parameter `r1` was incorrectly described as `PC` in parts of the documentation.  Thanks to Djordje BajiÄ‡ (GitHub username `djbajic`) for reporting this error!
- Removed option `seed` from all functions that had it.  For the same behavior, call `set.seed(seed)` before calling the function.
- Functions `jackstraw_lfa` and `jackstraw_alstructure`: removed `devR` option.
- Removed redundant functions
  - `lfa.corpcor`: same as `lfa::lfa` with option `override = TRUE`
  - `pi0est_bootstrap`: redundant with `qvalue::pi0est` with option `pi0.method = 'bootstrap'`
  - `dev.R` (internal; functionality implemented in package `gcatest`)
  - `devdiff_parallel` (internal; redundant with `gcatest::gcat.stat`)
  - `getp` (internal; redundant with `qvalue::empPvals`)

# jackstraw 1.3.5.9000 (2021-05-14)

- Function `jackstraw_lfa` now accepts genotypes input as `BEDMatrix` objects.
  In this case, the function operates on a low-memory mode, keeping data on disk rather than memory as much as possible, and writes permuted data into temporary files as well.
  To enable this mode, the `BEDMatrix` and `genio` packages are now dependencies.
  Note only `jackstraw_lfa` supports `BEDMatrix` because `lfa` supports it too (most recent fork; see below).
- Removed function `devdiff`, which is redundant (and replaced internally) with `gcatest::delta_deviance_lf`, a function that supports more special cases, including genotypes accessed through a `BEDMatrix` object.
  The only internal dependencies were `jackstraw_lfa` and `jackstraw_alstructure`.
- Updated `README.md` to instruct users to install the most updated forks of `lfa` and `gcatest` on GitHub (under username `alexviiia`), rather than the Bioconductor versions that are lacking critical updates.

# jackstraw 1.3.5.9000 (2021-06-21)

- Version was not bumped accidentally
- Removed old vignette
- Fixed a small error in `jackstraw_lfa` example

# jackstraw 1.3.6.9000 (2022-02-08)

- All `jackstraw_*` functions now return `NA` p-values for `NA` statistics.
  - Before `NA` statistics resulted in p-values of 1 instead, which is what `qvalue::empPvals` returns.  Now an internal wrapper function ensures the desired behavior.
- Removed two `jackstraw_pam` toy example unit tests that failed often due to colinearity.
- Reformatted this `NEWS.md` slightly to improve its automatic parsing.

# jackstraw 1.3.9.9000 (2022-11-28)

- Heavy updates to `README.md`
- Updated summary in `DESCRIPTION`
- Updated paper citations and URLs across function documentation
- Bumped version to exceed CRAN versions (which are currently on a separate branch due to temporary issues with dependencies `lfa` and `gcatest`)

# jackstraw 1.3.10.9000 (2023-08-03)

- Function `jackstraw_MiniBatchKmeans`: internally added `suppressWarnings` wrapper around `ClusterR::predict_MBatchKMeans` to silence a misleading deprecation warning.  The function as a whole is not deprecated, but its output for a case we don't use (fuzzy=TRUE) is changing in the future.  Warning message now being suppressed:
  - `predict_MBatchKMeans()` was deprecated in `ClusterR` 1.3.0.
  - Beginning from version 1.4.0, if the fuzzy parameter is TRUE the function `predict_MBatchKMeans` will return only the probabilities, whereas currently it also returns the hard clusters
- Removed strict dependence of the `alstructure` R package (on GitHub only), user now has to provide the function to apply to data for `jackstraw_alstructure` to work.
- Documentation
  - Corrected citation links for two similar papers
  - Function documentation (.Rd files) was actually updated as described in the last version (last commit had source .R files edited but not their .Rd counterparts).
  - Added a recent missing `NEWS.md` entry
  - Replaced two links that gave errors in `README.md`

Changes manually ported from latest CRAN branch:

- Minor non-code edits
  - Spell checked documentation
  - Changed to single maintainer (Neo)
  - Removed `VignetteBuilder: knitr` since there's no vignette anymore
  - Fixed broken or outdated URLs
  - Removed package dependency `parallel` which is not being used.
  - Removed many package suggested dependencies (`knitr`, `rmarkdown`, `ggplot2`, `mutoss`, `Matrix`, `gridExtra`, `cowplot`, `scales`, `formatR`) that were only used in a vignette currently not being built.
  - Reduced example dimensions for `jackstraw_irlba` and `jackstraw_rpca` by 5 to keep their runtime low.

# jackstraw 1.3.11.9000 (2023-08-03)

- Function `jackstraw_lfa` added option `permute_alleles`, to change default genotype permutation to an allele-level permutation algorithm that results in much more Binomial data, particularly when input data is highly structured.

# jackstraw 1.3.12.9000 (2024-08-01)

- `README` edited installation instructions to reflect that dependencies `lfa` and `gcatest` are now updated on Bioconductor (no need to install GitHub versions) and `alstructure` is now optional.
- Function `jackstraw_lfa` changed option `permute_alleles` to default to `TRUE`, which performs much better, and documentation now recommends against changing that option except for research purposes.
- Corrected typos throughout, and marked code as such to prevent false positives.

# jackstraw 1.3.13 (2024-08-01)

- CRAN submission
- DESCRIPTION replaced `Author` and `Maintainer` with `Authors@R` field
- Function `jackstraw_lfa` silenced warnings that occurs only if input is `BEDMatrix` object and OS is Windows, in which case some temporary files cannot be deleted during the R session.
- Created `cran-comments.md`

# jackstraw 1.3.14 (2024-08-29)

- `README` edited. Use cases as a separate subsection.
- Description in `DESCRIPTION` edited.

# jackstraw 1.3.15 (2024-08-30?)

- Use DOIs instead of publication URLs, as required by CRAN.

# jackstraw 1.3.16 (2024-09-12)

- Moved Bioconductor dependencies (`qvalue`, `lfa`, and `gcatest`) from Imports to Suggests, as required by CRAN.  Dependent functions will now only work if those packages are installed: 
  - Package `qvalue` is required for function `pip`.
  - Package `lfa` is required for functions `pseudo_Rsq` and `efron_Rsq`, and in practice for `jackstraw_lfa` too.
  - Package `gcatest` is required for functions `jackstraw_alstructure` and `jackstraw_lfa`.
  - Function `jackstraw_lfa` now requires option `FUN` to be defined and provided by the user (it used to default to the `lfa` function)
  - Internal function `empPvals` is now a copy of the function of the same name in the `qvalue` package, with minor adaptations.  This is to ensure most `jackstraw` functions, which depend on `empPvals`, work without `qvalue`.

# jackstraw 1.3.17 (2024-09-16)

- `m` increased in unit tests to pass building in CRAN `r-devel-windows-x86_64`
- `README` edited
